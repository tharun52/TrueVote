Requirements for the project
API Technical Specification Document
1. Overview
* API Type: RESTful API
* Protocol: HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)(optional)
* Content Type: application/json
* Authentication: JWT (Role-Based Authorization)
* Rate Limiting: 1000 requests/hour per user (configurable)
* Versioning: URI-based (/api/v1/)
* Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0
 
2. Functional Requirements
The API must support the following high-level features:
* User Authentication (Login, Logout, Token Refresh)
* Role-Based Access Control
* CRUD operations on core entities
* File Upload support (e.g., profile picture, attachments)
* Search, Filter, Sort, and Pagination
* Audit Logging of all data changes(Selection based on requirement)
* Optional: Real-time update notifications (SignalR/WebSockets)
 
3. Security Requirements
* JWT Bearer Authentication with Access + Refresh Tokens
* Password hashing using BCrypt
* Authorization based on user roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer)
* Input validation & sanitization //\\
* HTTPS enforced across environments(Optional)
* CORS configuration for frontend clients
* Role-based policy enforcement in controllers(Based on requirement)

5. Request & Response Standards
* Request Headers:
    * Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
    * Content-Type: application/json
* Standard Response Format:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Item fetched successfully",
  "data": { /* object or array */ },
  "errors": null
}
* Error Response Format:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "data": null,
  "errors": {
    "field": ["Error message"]
  }
}

6. Pagination Standard
* Supported via query parameters:
    * page (default: 1)
    * pageSize (default: 10, max: 100)
http
CopyEdit
GET /api/v1/items?page=2&pageSize=25
* Response example:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "totalRecords": 120,
    "page": 2,
    "pageSize": 25,
    "totalPages": 5
  }
}
 
7. Database Guidelines
* Use GUID or long as primary key
* Soft delete support using IsDeleted flag
* Audit columns: CreatedAt, CreatedBy, UpdatedAt, UpdatedBy
 
8. Logging & Monitoring
* Use structured logging (e.g., Serilog)
* Track all API calls with timestamps, user IDs, endpoint names
* Log errors with stack traces
* Enable Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
 
9. Testing
* Unit Testing for services and controllers (xUnit/NUnit)
* Integration Testing with in-memory DB
* Postman Collection for all endpoints
* Contract testing if third-party services are integrated
